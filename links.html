        <h1>DEI Statement</h1>
        <h2>
            Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement*
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a Black woman, in any context but especially in the field of economics, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
            is among the very top of my priorities. Personally living similar experiences as so many individuals belonging to 
            underrepresented groups is a constant reminder of how important promotion and engagement in DEI is to the growth 
            of organizations. I feel a strong responsibility to ensure that not only other Black women, but also men and women 
            from all underrepresented racial, ethnic, cultural, geographic, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, 
            disability, and socioeconomic backgrounds can see themselves pursuing their ideal careers in economics and related 
            fields. Also, as a cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied, U.S. born citizen I recognize there are challenges in 
            being a member of the economics profession which I do not necessarily face, and I want to do my part to ensure 
            representatives for their voices are included as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The American Economic Association's (AEA) Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession 
            (CSMGEP), Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP), and Committee on the Status of 
            LGBTQ+ Individuals in the Economics Profession (CSQIEP) play important roles in promoting DEI across the economics 
            field, but it's important for every institution, department, and individual researcher, faculty, staff, and student 
            to do his/her/their part to make the field more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. Thus, while the efforts of these 
            committees, either through the information sharing (e.g., newsletters, action items, and minority and women 
            representation via annual reports), recognition, or mentorship, are essential, if economics more broadly is ignorant 
            of these initiatives, DEI will be difficult to realize. If economics continues to remain a relatively homogenous group 
            of researchers, much of our work will become irrelevant to most individuals. Economists will fail to take up research 
            questions, or consider alternative assumptions and mechanisms, which are related to a diverse community of individuals; 
            having more diverse views and backgrounds is crucial to making our research more representative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Engaging in DEI happens in research, teaching, publishing, recruiting, admissions, hiring/promotions, and daily 
            interactions. Departments and other organizations which build their culture around DEI will create a positive work 
            and/or school environment for every individual. Our attitudes and behaviors can often create a culture of exclusivity, 
            especially in academia, which discourage individuals who cannot relate to those experiences from joining in. Also, if 
            departments recognize the barriers members of underrepresented groups face in entering the field, then they can come 
            up with alternative approaches to engaging with those groups to invite them into economics. These considerations, not 
            just thinking about the diversity in DEI, but also equity and inclusion, can make a big difference in achieving DEI 
            objectives.
