            Abstract: Do race-neutral school safety policies have race-neutral impacts? In this 
            paper, I present novel findings on the effects of statewide law enforcement 
            credential and special training requirements for school resource officers (SROs) on 
            Black-White gaps in suspensions, expulsions, law enforcement referrals, and 
            school-related arrests (i.e., school exclusion). I answer these questions using data 
            from the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights' 2013-14 through 
            2020-21 Civil Rights Data Collection school-level surveys and supplementary sources. 
            The study leverages state and time variation in adopting SRO credential and training 
            statutes between 2014-15 and 2020-21. The analysis compares Black-White school 
            exclusion gaps in majority and minority Black middle and high schools with SROs 
            between treated and untreated schools. I estimate average treatment effects on the 
            treated using an advanced difference-in-difference method, clustered by state. The 
            results indicate that requiring SROs to hold sworn law enforcement credentials more 
            than doubles racial gaps in suspensions and law enforcement referrals in majority 
            Black schools but not in minority Black schools and that SRO training policies have 
            no significant relationship with racial school exclusion gaps. I then evaluate whether 
            racial differences in school exclusion outcomes result from individual behaviors and 
            cultural norms or structural factors like systemic discrimination—the first study to 
            assess whether individualist or structuralist explanations underlying the relationship 
            between SROs and racial disparities in school discipline better explain the findings. 
            The findings suggest the need for structural, race-conscious policy changes to address 
            racial disparities in school discipline.

            Abstract: This study investigates whether increased funding for public schools can reduce 
            violent crime exposure among Black males in the United States. Recognizing that local 
            governments often face trade-offs between school funding and public safety, we examine 
            the impact of increased state funding during the school finance reform era. State finance 
            reforms aimed at disadvantaged communities led to significant cash infusions for 
            low-income school districts. Our findings reveal that counties with higher shares of 
            low-income school districts experienced a relative decrease in homicide rates for young 
            Black males following these reforms. Additionally, the reform-induced increase in school 
            spending contributed to a broader decline in homicides among Black men of all ages from 
            1970 to 2010. These results suggest that investing in education can play a crucial role 
            in reducing violent crime and addressing racial disparities in crime victimization.

            Investigating Racial Inequity in School Suspensions and Its Compounding Effects in the Labor Market
        </h3>

            Abstract: Success in the labor market is often contingent upon access to educational 
            resources. Black students, however, are disproportionately denied these resources due to 
            school suspensions and are also more likely to face labor market discrimination as adults. 
            This paper investigates the relationship between racial disparities in school suspensions 
            and adult employment and earnings. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth – 1997 
            Cohort, I examine the intersection of race, school suspensions, and labor market outcomes to 
            understand how suspensions impact long-term employment prospects for Black and White 
            individuals. I employ two-way fixed effects models to identify the relationships between 
            K-12 suspension and post-secondary employment and earnings. Descriptive results demonstrate 
            that suspensions are related to increased unemployment, decreased weeks and hours worked, 
            and earned income. Black individuals who were ever suspended are more likely to work fewer 
            weeks and hours and earn lower income than White individuals who were ever suspended. 
            Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions suggest that suspension may explain part of the racial gaps in 
            post-secondary labor outcomes. However, the unexplained portion of the gap remains after 
            including other characteristics. The insights from this study illuminate how racial inequality 
            in education exacerbates economic disparities later in life. Additionally, this research has 
            significant implications for policies addressing racial inequality within hierarchical systems 
            such as education and the labor market.

            Abstract: Due to asymmetric information, employers often need help assessing high school graduates' 
            employability. To address this, Indiana developed the Governor's Work Ethic Certificate (GWEC), an 
            initiative for twelfth-grade students to demonstrate skills and characteristics valued by 
            employers. Recognized by local employers and post-secondary institutions, the GWEC aims to assist 
            students in securing employment or admission to further education. With support from the Smith 
            Richardson Foundation, this study evaluates the potential impact of the GWEC on post-secondary jobs 
            and wages by analyzing program data from select participating schools linked with state 
            administrative workforce records. We estimate the local average treatment effect on employment and 
            earnings using a regression discontinuity design based on the GWEC completion criteria. We also 
            investigate racial differences in the benefits of completing the GWEC initiative. The findings could 
            inform improvements to the GWEC program and provide a model for similar workforce development 
            programs in other states, ultimately enhancing high school graduates' transition into the workforce.

            Evaluating the Causal Relationships between Literacy and School Discipline

        </h3>

            Abstract: Does low literacy cause more school discipline, or do disciplinary issues cause lower 
            literacy? This study investigates the causal relationships between literacy and school discipline by 
            asking this question. Using administrative data from a midsize school district in Minnesota, we 
            employ rigorous causal inference methods to estimate the impacts of literacy levels on school 
            discipline rates and vice versa. By quantifying these effects bidirectionally, we aim to identify 
            which direction has the most substantial influence. Additionally, we explore racial differences in 
            these relationships to understand potential disparities among student groups. Our study contributes 
            to the education policy landscape by shedding light on the root causes of literacy and discipline 
            issues, offering insights that can inform targeted reforms. By clarifying the causal pathways, our 
            indings seek to enhance interventions to improve educational outcomes and reduce disparities in 
            school discipline practices.

            Racial Disparities in the School-to-Prison Pipeline: Investigating the Impacts of South Carolina’s School Disturbance Law

        </h3>
        
        <p> 
            Abstract: The school-to-prison pipeline (STPP) encompasses the policies and processes that remove 
            students from the U.S. K-12 education system and place them into the juvenile or adult carceral 
            system. Black students are disproportionately more likely to experience the STPP than White students. 
            In our study, we use a unique South Carolina law criminalizing school disturbances and administrative 
            data from the Department of Juvenile Justice to provide empirical evidence of the racial disparities 
            in the STPP. Using variations in the letter and interpretation of the law over time, we estimate the 
            effects of the school disturbance law on racial differences in referrals to the criminal/legal system. 
            The findings from our analysis could inform current reform efforts combatting the broad use of this 
            statute.
