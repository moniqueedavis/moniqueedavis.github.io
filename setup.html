            Monique E. Davis (she/her) is an applied micro and labor economist specializing in using empirical 
            methods to study the economics of racism, racial equity, and intergroup inequality. She is a Ph.D. 
            Candidate in the Applied Economics Graduate Program at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis-St. 
            Paul, MN.
        </p>
        <p>
            Monique was born in Chicago, IL and raised in the Chicagoland area. In 2013, she earned Bachelor of 
            Science degrees in Applied Mathematics and Economics from North Carolina A&T State University, an HBCU* 
            in Greensboro, NC. Before returning to school in 2019, she worked for six years at JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
            where she spent the first two years in Columbus, OH in a rotational development program supporting 
            various roles, and the last four years she worked as a big data analyst/data scientist in New York, NY. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Monique's career and research interests as an economist are largely motivated by her experiences, both 
            lived and observed, within her family and broader African-American communities in the southside of 
            Chicago and surrounding areas. Monique seeks to identify root causes that explain the differences in 
            inequitable outcomes between privileged and marginalized communities, particularly regarding the Black 
            community, and leverage the resulting knowledge to inform policy changes, structural and otherwise, which 
            bring us closer to social equity and justice.
