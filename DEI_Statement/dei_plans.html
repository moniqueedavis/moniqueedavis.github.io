            Plans to Advance DEI
        </h2>
        <p>
            Given the push for DEI across many organizations, I feel confident in my ability to serve on DEI committees as I 
            progress throughout my career and work hard to incorporate substantive efforts towards cultural change and 
            advancement of DEI, not just in my department or organization, but in economics more broadly. I will add to action 
            item lists that individuals and organizations can do to understand and execute our DEI objectives. I will formalize 
            education and accountability in such a way that reduces exclusive and micro-aggressive attitudes and behaviors in 
            and out of the classroom and/or workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will integrate recruitment and marketing strategies for my organization that target members of underrepresented 
            groups at each stage of the pipeline, so we are reaching diverse applicants and candidates before they are discouraged 
            away from the field of economics. I will also mentor members of underrepresented groups to encourage them to pursue 
            economics as a career choice and help them navigate and overcome barriers which they are likely to face as a student 
            and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
           As I progress further in my career, I will seek leadership positions in committees like CSMGEP and CSWEP which have a 
            further reach and influence on the advancement of DEI in the field. I will also look to serve on the editorial boards 
            of the top economics journals, general and field topics, to add more representation for the publication process. 
            Publishing is crucial in the advancement of research careers, and the disparities in publishing in top journals for 
            underrepresented groups contributes to the lack of DEI in economics. While the feasibility of some of these plans 
            may be questionable for any one individual, if all of us can prioritize advancing DEI as an essential part of our 
            daily responsibilities, it will ease the burden for the current leaders in DEI.
